## 📌 Assignment Description

This  assignment focuses on handling **imbalanced datasets** using different sampling techniques and evaluating their impact on various machine learning classification models.  
The dataset used is a **credit card fraud detection dataset**, where fraudulent transactions are extremely rare compared to legitimate ones.

The objective is to study how classical sampling methods and **SMOTE-based oversampling** affect model accuracy.

## 🎯 Objectives

- To analyze the problem of **class imbalance** in real-world datasets  
- To apply multiple **sampling techniques** on imbalanced data  
- To train different **machine learning models** on sampled data  
- To compare the **accuracy** of models across sampling methods  
- To understand why advanced techniques like **SMOTE** are preferred

## 📊 Dataset Information

- **Dataset Name**: Creditcard_data.csv  
- **Problem Type**: Binary Classification (Fraud Detection)  
- **Class Distribution**:
  - `Class 0`: Normal transactions (Majority class)
  - `Class 1`: Fraudulent transactions (Minority class)

Due to the highly imbalanced nature of the dataset, direct training leads to biased models. Hence, sampling techniques are required.

## 🛠️ Sampling Techniques Used

### 1️⃣ Original Data
- Dataset used without any sampling
- Serves as a **baseline** for comparison

### 2️⃣ Random Sampling
- Random selection of samples from the dataset
- Simple and fast
- Does not guarantee class balance

### 3️⃣ Stratified Sampling
- Ensures proportional representation of each class
- Maintains class distribution
- Suitable for imbalanced datasets

### 4️⃣ Cluster Sampling
- Treats each class as a cluster
- Samples data from each cluster
- Useful when data can be grouped logically

### 5️⃣ Bootstrap Sampling
- Sampling with replacement
- Commonly used in ensemble methods
- Helps estimate model stability

### 6️⃣ SMOTE Oversampling
- **Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique**
- Generates synthetic data points for the minority class
- Reduces bias towards the majority class
- Discussed in classroom lectures and used as the primary imbalance-handling method
